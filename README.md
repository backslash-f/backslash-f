### Howdy! 👋🏻

So this was my first computer:

A [Sinclair ZX81 clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFAWHB2BKOg) with outstanding [16 KB RAM](https://k1.spdns.de/Vintage/Sinclair/80/Clones/Prológica%2C%20Brazil). I learned some [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) on one of these. I was about 12 years old. [I had to load programs through a cassette tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnHW-f5ayhs). I would spend 20 min or more hoping the tape wasn't damaged and the cassette player had a clean head. If everything went fine I would be able to run a program. If not, it would fail silently. Another option was of course writing programs from scratch before using them, which was very time-consuming. I experimented a lot with that machine and it was... awesome!

**Many** years later and here I am still enjoying every bit of programming I can do. 🙃

Cheers! 🍻
