### Greetings! üëãüèª

Here's a snapshot of my first-ever computer:

It was a [clone of the Sinclair ZX81](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFAWHB2BKOg) and boasted an impressive [16 KB RAM](https://k1.spdns.de/Vintage/Sinclair/80/Clones/Prol√≥gica%2C%20Brazil/). At around 12 years old, I began to [learn](https://i.imgur.com/1717IAm.jpg) some [BASIC programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) on this machine. To load programs, I had to use a cassette tape, which could take 20 minutes or more, while hoping the tape wasn't damaged and the cassette player head was clean. If all went well, I could run a program; if not, it would fail without warning. An alternative was writing programs from scratch before using them - this was time-consuming but allowed me to experiment extensively with the machine. It was truly amazing!

Fast forward to today, and I still find every bit of programming just as exciting! Although now, I mainly work with Swift/iOS.

Cheers to our journeys! üçª
