### Greetings! 👋🏻

Here's a snapshot of my very first computer:

This little machine — a Brazilian clone of the [Sinclair ZX81](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFAWHB2BKOg) — came with a _whopping_ **16 KB of RAM** and absolutely blew my 12-year-old mind. It's where I wrote my first lines of [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), usually after waiting 20+ minutes for programs to (hopefully) load from a cassette tape.

If the stars aligned — the tape wasn't chewed, the cassette head was clean, and everything was perfect — the program would load. If not? It failed _silently_, and you started over. The alternative was typing programs manually from [magazines or books](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e5a2dc6-ba02-4d74-a4ae-169a488e4cc9), which took forever but gave me full freedom to experiment. And honestly... it was magical. ✨

Fast-forward to today, and that excitement never faded — it simply evolved. I'm still driven by the same curiosity, except now it's mostly focused on Swift and iOS development.

Here's to the journey so far — and whatever we build next! 🍻
