### Howdy! 👋🏻

So this was my first computer:

A [Sinclair ZX81 clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFAWHB2BKOg) with outstanding [16 KB RAM](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiSwKGEp6_tAhWyy4UKHdN9B88QFjAHegQIEBAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1.spdns.de%2FVintage%2FSinclair%2F80%2FClones%2FProlo%25CC%2581gica%252C%2520Brazil%2F&usg=AOvVaw2vsc7dd_lNfyYQU0yDWCGR). I [learned](https://i.imgur.com/1717IAm.jpg) some [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) on one of these. I was about 12 years old. [I had to load programs through a cassette tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnHW-f5ayhs). I would spend 20 min or more hoping the tape wasn't damaged and the cassette player had a clean head. If everything went fine I would be able to run a program. If not, it would fail silently. Another option was of course writing programs from scratch before using them, which was very time-consuming. I experimented a lot with that machine and it was awesome.

2000 years later and here I am still enjoying every bit of programming I can do! (Mainly Swift/iOS nowadays).

Cheers! 🍻🎶🍎📱🙃💻❤️🎮🏋🏻‍♂️
